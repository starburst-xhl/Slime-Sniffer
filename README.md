# slime-chunk-finder-for-xhl
A simple Java program for finding the round mob-spawnable region which has as many slime chunks as possible.

This is the README file for my "Minecraft Void Realm Slime Chunk Helper", a small program written in Java that can help you find the best slime chunks in the void realm. This is a preliminary version, with limited functionality, but I will keep improving and updating it.

The principle of this program is to match the slime chunks in a specified area by a circle, and find the circular area with the most slime chunks. This way you can build your slime farm in this area, and collect a lot of slime balls. I referred to the source code of minecraft Wiki, and I thank them for providing the generation algorithm of slime chunks.

The usage is very simple, you just need to run the Main class,then imnput your seed,the x and z in order to change the search range (do not exceed 2000, otherwise it will affect the efficiency). The program will output the center coordinates, as well as the number of slime chunks in that area. You can use this information to find the corresponding location in the game, and start building your slime farm.

I hope you like this program, if you have any suggestions or feedback, please contact me. Thank you!
